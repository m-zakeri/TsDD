# Testability-driven development (TsDD)

This repository contains the source code of our TsDD paper.
The rationale behind testability-driven development is to effectively use the testability measurement information in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This approach enforces developers to test a product's testability before testing it. However, the measurement by itself does not provide a considerable advantage. It must be accompanied by improvement of the components with poor testability. Hence, an improvement mechanism is embedded in TsDD relying on software refactoring techniques. The most interesting part of TsDD is that the overall process of testability measurement and improvement can be performed automatically. Despite TDD, which fades the advantage of using automated test data generation tools due to the early development of test cases, TsDD maximizes the usage of these by preparing source code before testing.
